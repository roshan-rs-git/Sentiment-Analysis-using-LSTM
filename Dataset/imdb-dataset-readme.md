# IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) specifically collected for sentiment analysis tasks. . Each review has been labeled as either positive (rating ≥ 7 out of 10) or negative (rating ≤ 4 out of 10), making this a binary classification dataset.

## Origin

The dataset was originally created by researchers at Stanford University and is described in the paper:

## Dataset Characteristics

- **Size**: 50,000 reviews total(25,000 positive, 25,000 negative)
- **Format**: Text files
- **Labels**: Binary (Positive/Negative)
- **Balance**: Perfectly balanced (50% positive, 50% negative)
- **Features**: Raw text reviews

## Purpose

This dataset was designed to allow researchers and practitioners to:

1. Build and evaluate sentiment analysis models
2. Work with a larger, more challenging dataset than earlier benchmarks
3. Train word embeddings for sentiment analysis
4. Develop natural language processing techniques for movie review analysis

## Using the Dataset

This dataset is well-suited for:

```
Binary sentiment classification
Text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques
Word embedding training
Evaluating machine learning and deep learning models
Natural language processing education and research
```
